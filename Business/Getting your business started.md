### Getting your business started

There are a lot of misconceptions when it comes to doing your own thing. This is advice to get you off the ground.

#### 1. Ignore the "real world"

Don't believe others when they say your idea won't work out. The world in which your idea won't work is merely an excuse, a justification for not trying. It has nothing to do with you.

#### 2. Success is the experience that actually counts

You learn a lot from failure, namely what not to do again. But you learn even more from success, which is ammunition you can use next time around.

#### 3. Planning is guessing

All long-term business plans are fantasies. You cannot predict the future with so many factors at play. You have more information when you're doing something, so don't make a detailed plan beforehand. It's better to be able to improvise.

#### 4. Find your perfect size

The size of your company is no measure of its success. Grow slowly until you find what works for you, and don't feel pressured to hiring more just because.

#### 5. Workaholism is not an ideal

You won't save the day, you'll just use it up. Efficiency and clever thinking follows good rest, not to mention the inevitable burnout. 

#### 6. You don't need to be a "special breed"

There are no such thing as *entrepreneurs*. They're just people who have started their own companies, and so can you. There are no prerequisites. 

#### 7. Make a dent in the universe

To do great work, you need to feel that you're making a difference. This does not necessarily entail curing cancer, but your efforts need to feel valuable. 

#### 8. Scratch your own itch

Make something *you want to use*. It's easier to come up with ideas that way, and it's easier to build them. 

#### 9. Start making something

Ideas are worth nothing, execution is everything. So just get to it, there is no such time as the perfect time. 

#### 10. No time is no excuse

There's always time, you just have to prioritize. Give up an hour or two of TV time a day, or just be more efficient overall. If you want it bad enough, you'll always find the time to get started.

#### 11. Make a stand

Great businesses have a point of view, something they believe in. This is what makes your company and your products unique. Surely you'll make a few enemies, but you'll make even more customers. You can't please them all.

#### 12. And stand by it

Having something you believe in isn't worth much if you don't stand by it. 

#### 13. Avoid outside money

Don't give up control of your company for a few checks. Chances are it'll screw you over in the long run. Stay independent for as long as possible.

#### 14. You need less than you think 

Being frugal is the way to go. Everything that will slow you and your progress down is merely a distraction, so just get started and get the things down the road.

#### 15. Act like an actual business

Startups often ignore reality. Aim to be a profitable sustainable business out the door, and chances you'll succeed are a lot higher.

#### 16. Don't build companies to sell

Companies with the intention of being acquired focus on the wrong things. Don't worry about who's going to buy you, emphasize customer relationships and product.

#### 17. Less mass is good

The less things holding you back (employees, inventory, contracts, offices, etc.) the more lean you are. Less energy, money, and effort is required to change directions, which might happen more often than you think.

#### 18. Embrace constraints

With no room for waste, limited resources force you to make do with what you've got. It forces you to be creative. Constraints should be embraced, not avoided.

#### 19. Focus on one thing

Don't try to do it all at once. Focus on one thing, and doing it well.

#### 20. Start with the core features

There are lots of things you'd like to do, but you have to begin with the core feature. Figure out what makes your product, and work on that.

#### 21. Ignore the details

Details make a difference, but don't get lost in things that don't really matter. Nail the basics first, and worry about the specifics later.

#### 22. Make quick decisions

Get into the rythm of making choices, because that is progress. Don't postpone, but get it out of the way.

#### 23. Less is more

Constantly look for things to remove, ways to simplify and streamline your products. Don't just throw everything you've got in there, but make sure it serves a purpose and keep only what is truly essential.

#### 24. Trim down problems

Don't escalate problems by throwing more at it. Simplify and then fix.

#### 25. Focus on what won't change

Trends fade, but certain features are forever. Focus on what never goes out of style, and you'll have a business that'll last a long time.

#### 26. It's not the equipment

Better equipment may simplify things a little, but there is no shortcut to success. Do with what you've got, and just get started. 

#### 27. Sell your by-products

To any business, there will always be a by-product. Try to find your by-product, and think about how you can monetize it.

#### 28. Launch now

Your product will never be finished, so get it in the hands of many as soon as possible. If you're not at least a little embarrassed by your product, you launched too late.
