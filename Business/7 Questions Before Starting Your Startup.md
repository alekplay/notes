### 7 Questions Before Starting Your Startup

There are seven questions every entrepreneur should address in his business plan, and without good answers the business will face problems and fail. 

#### 1. Engineering

*Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?*

The proprietary technology should be at least ten times better than its nearest substitute. Mere incremental improvements end up meaning no improvement at all to the end user.

#### 2. Timing 

*Is now the right time to start your particular business?*

The best markets are progressing quickly and can quickly develop products a magnitude better than their predecessors. Entering a slow moving market can be a good strategy, but only if you have a definite and realistic plan to take it over. 

#### 3. Monopoly

*Are you starting with a big share of a small market?*

To grow big, you have to think small. Huge markets mean ruthless, bloody competition. Start with something small, and grow out of it. But don't invent your own submarket, you can't dominate something that doesn't exist.

#### 4. People

*Do you have the right team?*

Assemble yourself a team that are not only good at both developing and selling your product, but also work well together.

#### 5. Distribution

*Do you have a way to not just create, but deliver your product?*

Selling and delivering is just as important as developing the product itself, technology doesn't sell itself.

#### 6. Durability

*Will your market position be defensible in 10-20 years in the future?*

Your business should plan to be the last mover in its particular market, so research how the world will look 20 years from now and plan so your business will fit in.

#### 7. Secret

*Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?*

Great companies have secrets, specific reasons for success that other people don't see. If yours is out in the open, you risk plentiful competition.
